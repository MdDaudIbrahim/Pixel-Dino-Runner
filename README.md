## üåü Introduction

Pixel-Dino-Runner is a nostalgic, pixel-art endless runner game inspired by the classic offline dinosaur game. Built with `p5.js`, it offers a simple yet addictive experience where players guide a pixelated dinosaur through an ever-increasingly challenging landscape, avoiding obstacles and aiming for the highest score. Jump over cacti, dodge flying creatures, and watch the game speed up as your score climbs!

This project serves as a fun and engaging example of game development using `p5.js` and fundamental web technologies, perfect for anyone looking for a quick diversion or a starting point for their own browser-based games.
